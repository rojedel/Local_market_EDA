# Local_market_EDA
In this project what I did was I built a python data scrapper to collect the publicly available grocery store item data. 

The main tools used to build the data scrapper were:
- BeautifulSoup4
- Requests
- csv
- etc.

I then performed exploratory data analysis on the collected data, to see what insight could be gathered from it. As for the analysis side, the main tools I used were:
- Pandas
- Plotly
- Matplotlib
